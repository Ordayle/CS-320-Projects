Ensuring functionality and security:
I ensure my code is functional and secure by writing thorough unit tests that cover both typical and edge cases, validating input data carefully, and anticipating how users might misuse the system. I also review my code regularly to catch potential vulnerabilities or logic flaws.

Interpreting user needs:
I interpret user needs by closely analyzing the project requirements and thinking about real-world scenarios where users might make mistakes. I design my validation and logic to not only meet specifications but also make the program intuitive and reliable for end users.

Approaching software design:
I approach designing software by emphasizing simplicity, efficiency, and scalability. I choose appropriate data structures, like hash maps for faster access when needed, and organize classes around clear, single responsibilities to keep the codebase clean and easy to maintain.
